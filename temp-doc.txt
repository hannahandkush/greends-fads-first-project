5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
This command copied a file from a parent directory into the current directory.
I had to modify the command because the file was within a separate directory.
I had to use .. to go up to /Users/hannahnathanson and then into the directory my-first-project where the text file was located before I could copy it into the current directory. 

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

git innit is a command for creating a new project whereas git clone is to copy an existing repository. 
This time I was using the cp command to copy a file instead of creating a new file.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.

The command to commit files is $ git commit 
Before I can commit the file, it needs to be in the index/staging area. 
I will start with $ git add temp-* to move the copied files from the working directory to the staging area.
Then I will be able to use $ commit temp-*
